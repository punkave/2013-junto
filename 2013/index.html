          <h3>The Junto Retreat</h3>
          <h4>A Retreat for Those that Lead (or Aspire to Lead) Businesses that are Not-Just-For-Profit</h4>
            <p>
              Many of us run businesses not only to support ourselves and the people we work with, but also as a way to make a positive impact in the world.
              In fact, some of us think it is the best way to help create the world we want to live in.
              We desire a consistency between who we are, what we believe, and the work we do.
              We are humans, and we want our businesses to be human . . . and profitable.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Junto retreat will be an opportunity to explore and connect our business practices with what we aspire to be and what impact we hope to make.

          <h3>What To Expect</h3>
          <p>
            Don't expect to be attending a conference. People won't be talking at you all day.
            This is intentionally and specifically a <em>retreat</em>.
            There will be some carefully curated talks, but the majority of the time will be for you to think, reflect, write, and share.
            There will also be some hands-on exercises and activities to help you reflect on what you stand for and what impact you hope to make.
          </p>
          <h3>Topics We'll Discuss:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How can I create the kind of company that I want to work at? (Don't forget you have to work there, too.)</li>
            <li>What do I stand for?</li>
            <li>How can I meld purpose and profit?</li>
            <li>How can I make decisions in my business that I can be proud of and that are profitable?</li>
            <li>How can I make my business matter more?</li>
            <li>How can I be more profitable while making a positive impact?</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Arch St. Meeting House</h3>
          <h5>320 Arch St. | Philadelphia, PA</h5>
          <p>The retreat will take place in the Arch St. Meeting House in the heart of Old City in Philadelphia. We'll be taking some strolls in the surrounding area, but in the spirit of the original Junto, most of our time will be spent in the traditional simplicity of the Quaker meeting house.</p>

          <h3>Why "Junto"?</h3>
          <p>
            The Junto was originally formed by Ben Franklin and his friends in 1727 "to exchange knowledge of business affairs" with the goal of mutual improvement.
            This diverse group of business leaders met on a regular basis to share knowledge that would improve themselves, their businesses, and their community.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have chosen to revive the spirit of the Junto in the form of this retreat, because we believe that running a business in a "not just for profit" way is rewarding both financially and emotionally.
            By coming together, as Franklin and his friends did, we hope to share valuable knowledge and reflections that can improve ourselves, our businesses, and our communities.

          <p>
            The price of the Junto includes all meals from some of Philadelphia's best restaurants.

          <h3>Join the Conversation</h3>
          <p>The Junto Retreat will be a time to meet other business owners and to develop meaningful relationship. Running a business can be a solitary experience if you don't have someone within your own business that understands the pressures. Intentional time will be scheduled for open dialogue with colleagues. Expect to share, learn, and maybe even be a little vulnerable along the way.</p>

          <p>This is strictly limited to 50 tickets, so grab your spot now if you know this will help you run your business in a more profitable and meaningful way.</p>
